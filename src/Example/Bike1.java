//Constructure is a special method in java that is used to initialize objects.
//Constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
//A constructor is called default constructor when it has no parameters.
//A constructor is called parameterized constructor when it has parameters.
//Constrctor are special in that sense that they have the same name as the class they are part of.
// They are also special that they are called by JVM automatically when you call and object.
